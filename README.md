# Trello team F

We couldn't submit result.

Program changes we made to solve the problem:
At fast, I tried running the program taken from github with the dataset, but it did not output any error messages. However, there was no output either.

(1) I changed [open("childrenStory.txt").read()] to [open("childrenStory.txt","r")] in line 527 of the program.
But, there was no output and no error messages.

(2) I attempted to change the part of main-code that seemed to be wrong further, but the function was already completed and I could not change the program in the function badly.
