Dataset is "childrenStory.txt".

We can't submit result.

Program changes to solve the problem:

At fast, I tried running the program taken from github with the dataset, but it did not output any error messages. However, there was no output either.

(1) I changed [open("childrenStory.txt").read()] to [open("childrenStory.txt","r")] in line 527 of the program.
But, there was no output and no error messages.

(2) Also, I added the name of the directory before the filename and ran it, but it did not show any output or error messages as in ().

(3) I attempted to change the part of main-code that seemed to be wrong further, but the function was already completed and I could not change the program in the function badly.

So, we can't.
